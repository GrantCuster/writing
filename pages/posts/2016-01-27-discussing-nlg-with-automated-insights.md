<p>On January 26, we co-hosted an online discussion with Robbie Allen, the founder and CEO of natural language generation software provider <a href="https://automatedinsights.com/">Automated Insights</a>.

Their latest release of Wordsmith allows non-technical business to define template language with less overhead from IT and professional service teams. </p><p>The webinar covers how NLG works, how different industries verticals are applying the technology, how users engage with Wordsmith, and where we suspect NLG will go in the near future. </p><p>Check it out, and let us know if you have questions about <a href="https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/nlg.html">our NLG resources</a>!</p>
