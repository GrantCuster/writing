<p>We’re excited to start 2016 by putting our Natural Language Generation (NLG) report and prototype <a href="https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/nlg.html">on sale</a>! We’re offering multiple packages, including a short report focused on business value for C-level executives. </p>

<p>NLG is a technology that allows software systems to write articles and reports. Our <a href="https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/nlg.html">RoboRealtor prototype</a> shows how to use NLG to generate real estate ads from a few apartment attributes (e.g., number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, onsite gym facilities, etc.). Our clients are using NLG to do things like automate personalized financial portfolio management reports and build virtual assistants that help companies onboard new employees more efficiently.<br/></p><p>One powerful application of NLG is personalized communications and product descriptions. Organizations across industry sectors, from <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/12/09/fashion-goes-deep-data-science-at-lyst.html">fashion</a> to <a href="http://www.nycmedialab.org/events/">publishing</a>, devote data science efforts to personalizing content and recommendations. On January 26 at 1:00 ET/10:00 PT, we’ll host an <a href="http://go.automatedinsights.com/WBN2016-01-26FastForwardLabs_Webinar.html?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCf1BXlUZj%2F%2FOUI73omzzOaZGvs6huR%2FTp36ldrjMWA4ykXA%3D%3D">online discussion</a> about how to use NLG to automate personalized content for clients, prospects, shoppers and internal audiences. Our own Hilary Mason will join Robbie Allen, founder and CEO of Automated Insights, to discuss the latest version of Wordsmith and other trends in NLG. <a href="http://go.automatedinsights.com/WBN2016-01-26FastForwardLabs_Webinar.html?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCf1BXlUZj%2F%2FOUI73omzzOaZGvs6huR%2FTp36ldrjMWA4ykXA%3D%3D">Join us</a>!</p><p>Send us an email at contact@fastforwardlabs.com if you have questions.
