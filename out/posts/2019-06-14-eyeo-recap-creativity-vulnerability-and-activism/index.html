clearly articulated some issues I&#x27;ve been thinking about for a while. This is a personal post and I&#x27;m nervous I&#x27;m bending the talks I mention to fit the narrative I&#x27;m after. I think this post is a step towards me thinking about these issues more clearly, but just a first step. The last section on activism feels particulary sketchy.</p><h2>Creativity and control</h2><p>There was a common structure to my favorite talks at <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/">Eyeo</a>:</p><ol><li>A person develops an intense creative process to deal with feeling vulnerable; a place where they are in control.</li><li>After some initial success, they realize the limitations of the space they&#x27;ve created.</li><li>They find a way to incorporate the feelings they&#x27;d been avoiding into their work, making themselves more vulnerable and their art stronger. (This process is often messy and incomplete.)</li></ol><p>This is my rough interpretation of the narrative of the talks I saw by <span person-ref="Nicole Aptekar"><a href="https://nicolation.net/">Nicole Aptekar</a></span>, <span person-ref="Nathan Yau"><a href="https://flowingdata.com/">Nathan Yau</a></span>, <span person-ref="Christina Curlee"><a href="http://www.christinazero.com/">Christina Curlee</a></span>, and <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis"><a href="https://soulellis.com/">Paul Soulellis</a></span>. All of them reacted to personal challenges by turning to art or design, and then found they needed to confront those challenges within their work:</p><ul><li><span person-ref="Nicole Aptekar">Nicole</span> has started to share more of the process behind <span person-ref="Nicole Aptekar">her</span> projects (including the poetry) in addition to the precision of the lasercut final artwork.</li><li><span person-ref="Nathan Yau">Nathan</span> is committed to moving out of <span person-ref="Nathan Yau">his</span> comfort zone and interacting with people beyond <span person-ref="Nathan Yau">his</span> writing and blog.</li><li><span person-ref="Christina Curlee">Christina</span> is incorporating more and more biographical elements into <span person-ref="Christina Curlee">their</span> videogame art worlds.</li><li><span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">Paul</span> shifted his publishing and archiving practice to focus on radical queer art and culture as he became more comfortable with his own identity.</li></ul><h2>It&#x27;s personal</h2><p>These talks were important to me because I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out similar issues for myself. In design, I&#x27;m focused on creating minimal ordered systems. This desire for order carries over to how I organize my life: I wear the same outfit everyday, I eat a lot of the same meals. I know that these habits are a reaction to being uncomfortable with ambiguity, and retreating to spaces I can control.</p><h3>Retreat or refuge</h3><p>Retreat is a negative interpretation of it, a more positive one would be that these spaces are a refuge, and that being able to visit them helps recover strength for dealing with the ambiguity in other parts of my life. I go back and forth on this. I think the ordered practices do help me recharge, but I worry they might lead to a desire to impose that order on all aspects of my life.</p><h2>Ambiguity is other people</h2><p>And what exactly am I retreating or finding refuge from? Other people. I often don&#x27;t know how other people are going to react and this stresses me out. On projects, I&#x27;ve dealt with this by doing more and more myself. Structuring them so I have less points of dependency on others. This is more comfortable but it&#x27;s also limiting. I need to decide if I&#x27;m OK with that. Right now, I&#x27;m not sure.</p><h3>Activism and organizing</h3><p>That question, of whether to retreat deeper into individual projects or make an effort to engage more with the outside world was put even more sharply by another group of talks, including <span person-ref="BUFU"><a href="http://www.bufubyusforus.com/">BUFU</a></span> and <span person-ref="Sasha Costanza-Chock"><a href="http://schock.cc/">Sasha Costanza-Chock</a></span>, focused on activisim and organizing. In organizing you&#x27;re forced to deal with the messiness of others. The design challenge is how to act within that messiness. The aim is not to set up a perfect system but rather one that is robust and has mechanisms for self-correction.</p><p>That feels like very important and worthwile work to me. It&#x27;s not the first time in my life I&#x27;ve wondered whether the truly responsible thing for me to do would be to get involved in community and political organizing. It&#x27;s worth noting how privilege plays out here as well. As <span person-ref="Sasha Costanza-Chock">Sasha</span>&#x27;s section on going through a TSA scanner as a nonbinary, transgender, femme-presenting person demonstrated, the way the world is set-up right now makes it impossible for people of marginalized identities to just go about their work. As a straight, cis, white man, those systems mostly will allow me to just make generative graph layouts all day. The question is whether my conscience will.</p><p><p><span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">Paul</span>&#x27;s talk was a really moving examination of these issues for me. As <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">he</span> reconciled with <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">his</span> queer identity, <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">he</span> started to bring it more into <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">his</span> work. He shifted <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">his</span>  archiving and publishing focus from  experimental internet work to experimental queer work, and structured his teaching to try and disrupt current systems. <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">His</span> talk raised the question of how to reconcile a love for experimental design with living in a world where other issues seem much more urgent. It felt like a very personal account of <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">him</span> working out an answer to that question for <span person-ref="Paul Soulellis">himself</span>.</p></p><p>Haunting all of this was <span person-ref="Jenny Odell"><a href="http://www.jennyodell.com/">Jenny Odell</a></span>&#x27;s book <em>How to Do Nothing</em>. I finished the book just before the conference. I was pleasantly surprised by how much of the book was focused on the connections between a creative practice and activism, and how to balance the two. I was particularly interested in the section on Thomas Merton, and how temporary withdrawal (or withdrawal in certain aspects) can fuel engagement. I think this is the most positive and convincing version of the creative practice as refuge idea: you can experiment with different modes of living within your scoped creative experiments, and then that energy back into your engagement with the world. I still have a lot to figure out in terms of what that balance could look like for myself, but I&#x27;m glad to be thinking and writing about it again.</p></div></div></div><div style="text-indent:24px;padding:12px" class="jsx-2046154511">Generated<!-- --> on <!-- -->6/17/2019, 3:24:27 PM<!-- -->.</div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/2019-06-14-eyeo-recap-creativity-vulnerability-and-activism","query":{},"buildId":"8s4uMfIc3_pOhXgq1bmqA","nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/posts/2019-06-14-eyeo-recap-creativity-vulnerability-and-activism" src="/_next/static/8s4uMfIc3_pOhXgq1bmqA/pages/posts/2019-06-14-eyeo-recap-creativity-vulnerability-and-activism.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/8s4uMfIc3_pOhXgq1bmqA/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-fdce77a122c11e06ae50.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.4b4009643e6c1a714277.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-6bc28664ebcf4fcd9654.js" async=""></script></body></html>
