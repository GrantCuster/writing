When we say a system is trustworthy, we mean that it will do exactly what we expect of it and nothing else.

If we delegate certain decisions to AI systems, we need to trust that they\'ll make those decisions correctly, but we also need to trust that they don\'t act in other ways we don\'t intend. With simple machine learning techniques like linear regression, we can backtrack to understand what input feature leads to a given output.

The role machine learning plays in this example is to amplify human attention by drawing attention to things that look different than the rest, enabling human decisions on defense, rather than aiming to replace security analysts outright. Another key area for ML in security is in detecting malicious software before it is activated.

A more difficult question is how to manage a privacy budget, for example, how many queries the differential privacy algorithms can tolerate before an adversary could identify that single record.

This is a hard problem: the research shows it's theoretically possible, but I'd like to explore making it more practical than we've managed to date. Imagine if we could distribute keys that only allow users to ask the questions they care about. Then instead of users coming to the data with arbitration at some central policy enforcement point, (encrypted) data can be sent to users, with the certainty that all they can learn is a specific kind of result. This is a conceptual complement to differential privacy: functional encryption controls what can be learned, and differential privacy controls with how much precision it can be learned. I'm also excited about other ways of computing on encrypted data. There are some tools out there, but they tend to only be practical on small data or simple computations. However, progress is being made. Imagine a future where a business could apply for a loan without revealing its financial situation to the bank, yet the bank can still have assurance that the loan is a good investment. Or, imagine a future where a patient can find out whether they're a good candidate for an advanced therapy without revealing their medical history or genome to the company offering the therapy, or to the insurance company paying for it - while still satisfying the need for those companies to know that the patient is a good candidate. It's incredibly powerful to be able to have the results we want without being able to see the underlying data that informs those results."))}l.isMDXComponent=!0}},[["K3Np","5d41","9da1"]]]);
