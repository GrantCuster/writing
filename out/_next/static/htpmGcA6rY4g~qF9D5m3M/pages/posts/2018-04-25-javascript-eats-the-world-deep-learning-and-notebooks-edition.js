It shows how training in the browser can help the model adapt to different contexts. For example, if you want your model to spot when a user raises their hand, a pre-trained model might have trouble if the user is sitting in a room surrounded by mannequins. Because you can train the Teachable Machine model with specific examples of both "raised hand" and "unraised hand," there\'s a good chance it will perform well in your weird mannequin room (a very specific situation).
