These are useful, and insightful, approaches to futurism in general, and there are good reasons why we still talk about Clarke and Asimov - their insights remain evergreen. We are hesitant, however, to see warnings about AI, particularly Musk's, as solely prescient warnings about the dangers he perceives.

Another takeaway is that we should all feel empowered to articulate our own "Laws of Robotics," "Adages of Futurism," or "Laws of AI."
