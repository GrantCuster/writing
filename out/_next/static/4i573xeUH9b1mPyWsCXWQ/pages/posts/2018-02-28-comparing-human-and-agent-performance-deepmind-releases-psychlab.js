"),Object(o.b)("p",null,"The research findings point out some potentially non-obvious ways in which the models used to build artificial agents are missing some fundamental aspects of how primate (human and non-human) vision and cognition operate. For instance, one experiment that tested psychophysical thresholds of an agent found that visual acuity was affected by the size of the images presented.  This led researchers to build a secondary model that loosely approximated the fovea (the center of the retina at the back of the eye, where sight is most acute) to improve performance. The need for this secondary model was only made clear by comparing performance of the agent to human performance and relating the difference back to human physical anatomy."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"Interestingly, the agent failed to produce many well-known effects in humans.

This will greatly increase the speed at which machine learning models will change based on cognitive science/neuroscience. This burgeoning era gives us a moment to pause, however, and think critically about what a particular business might want to gain by using machine learning. It’s clear that we’re not yet near a generalized Artificial Intelligence (and these experiments reinforce that idea). As machine learning algorithms borrow more and more from cognitive science/neuroscience, we can think of these models in different ways. We can think of them as evolving along the same trajectory as humans (akin to studying infant brains and how they change and evolve throughout a human’s life); we can look at these models as something related to human cognition, but fundamentally separate (akin to the research on non-human primates); or we can think of these models as performing something entirely their own - with no tie to human evolution or development."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"As this field continues to develop, and we begin to employ machine learning in every facet of business, it’s important to establish and maintain a goal for these tools, perhaps with these distinctions in mind."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}},[["hh2t","5d41","9da1"]]]);
