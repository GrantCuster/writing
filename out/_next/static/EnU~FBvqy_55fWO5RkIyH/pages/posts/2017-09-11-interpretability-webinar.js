For\nexample, if race is being used to make a decision for a really small number of\nindividuals, it might not show up in the global aggregations. Similarly, local\nexplanations are also useful in showing the sign of the dependence in context,\ni.e. age might be important overall, but for some individuals age might act as\na negative factor, and for a positive, and global explanations will not be able\nto capture that.
