I finished the book just before the conference. I was pleasantly surprised by how much of the book was focused on the connections between a creative practice and activism, and how to balance the two. I was particularly interested in the section on Thomas Merton, and how temporary withdrawal (or withdrawal in certain aspects) can fuel engagement. I think this is the most positive and convincing version of the creative practice as refuge idea: you can experiment with different modes of living within your scoped creative experiments, and then that energy back into your engagement with the world. I still have a lot to figure out in terms of what that balance could look like for myself, but I'm glad to be thinking and writing about it again."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0},Xj0z:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",function(){return c}),n.d(t,"b",function(){return u});var o=n("0iUn"),r=n("sLSF"),i=n("MI3g"),a=n("a7VT"),s=n("Tit0"),l=n("q1tI"),h=n.n(l),c=function(e){function t(){return Object(o.default)(this,t),Object(i.default)(this,Object(a.default)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(s.default)(t,e),Object(r.default)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return h.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"#555",marginBottom:"1.5rem",textIndent:0}},"Certainty: ",this.props.children)}}]),t}(h.a.Component),u=(h.a.Component,h.a.Component,function(e){function t(){return Object(o.default)(this,t),Object(i.default)(this,Object(a.default)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(s.default)(t,e),Object(r.default)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this.props,t=e.p,n=e.v,o=(e.m,e.link),r=e.cap,i=t.short;return"full"===n&&(i=t.full),"they"===n&&(i=t.pronouns[0]),"them"===n&&(i=t.pronouns[1]),"their"===n&&(i=t.pronouns[2]),"theirs"===n&&(i=t.pronouns[3]),"themself"===n&&(i=t.pronouns[1]+"self"),r&&(i=i.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+i.slice(1)),o&&(i=h.a.createElement("a",{href:t.link},i)),h.a.createElement("span",{"person-ref":t.full},i)}}]),t}(h.a.Component));h.a.Component},qNsG:function(e,t,n){"use strict";var o=n("4mXO"),r=n.n(o),i=n("pLtp"),a=n.n(i);function s(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,i=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r={},i=a()(e);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)n=i[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(r[n]=e[n]);return r}(e,t);if(r.a){var s=r()(e);for(o=0;o<s.length;o++)n=s[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(i[n]=e[n])}return i}n.d(t,"a",function(){return s})}},[["Nv0h","5d41","9da1"]]]);
