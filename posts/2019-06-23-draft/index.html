our thinking. I recently got excited about this idea reading <a href=""><em>Metaphors We Live By</em></a>. The early chapters of <em>Metaphors We Live By</em> put forward a model of thinking that looks to me like it could clarify a bunch of language ambituities that I had kind of given up on clarifying. It looks at how we use metahpors drawn from our embodied experience to make sense of more abstract concepts.</p><p>An example: more is up. Look up the contradictory example which is shown to not be in conflict because both are drawn from different physical models.</p><p>I find writing very stressful. I try to make precise sentences and coherent use of metaphor. I often want to have perfectly balanced sentences, and I get so caught up in those that I lose the thread of my overall argument. I&#x27;ve tried to counter that by writing more concretely, and without trying to fit into a narrative, but I still get stressed. I know what good stuff looks like, and feel frustrated I&#x27;m not able to write it.</p><p>I also know I tend to get better feedback on the more complex stuff, and I respond to that feedback. This is true in design as well. I&#x27;ve been trying to go back to the fundamentals, what in programming are called primitives, and start from there. I think because I have seen in code how powerful those can be, and how you might have to trust that they&#x27;ll prove their value, even if it makes for some intermediate awkwardness. So I&#x27;ve moved to a more ascetic, minimalist approach. I think this causes me to pass up some opportunities for fun, but I hope I&#x27;mon the right journey. I&#x27;ve been pleased with some of the results.</p><p>For writing, this process has been harder. Despite being an English major, I was too impatient to develop a really strong sense of grammar. Part of this is the influence of learning code on how I look at language. I&#x27;m getting older and worried whether I&#x27;ve chosen the right work path, but one thing is I&#x27;m more sure than ever that I can learn things (it&#x27;s more the choosing what that is the issue). I had treated a discomfort with language as something I&#x27;d always have to live with while writing. After experiences in other domains it now feels like I could just learn more about it. It felt more approachable.</p><p>I did like that Steven Pinker quote about the weird linearity of language. (could I structure an entry around the metaphor example and the Pinker quote?)</p><p>Syntax things were interesting, but now I&#x27;m finidng out I may have been more interested in how thought was structured than in how language is (of course they&#x27;re intertwined).</p><p>I wanted to do some code experiments with metaphor, to force concreteness. I was not so successful. Also, as a foster parent who now has lots of time to read while doing light park supervision duty, it&#x27;s easier right now for me to read more than to do code experiments. So I decided to read further, and somehow I found my way back to Hofstadter. I&#x27;ve read part of GEB several times, but this time I thought I&#x27;d check out the papers. One of his focuses in analogy., which seems functionally the same as how metaphor is used in <em>Metaphors We Live By</em>. He talks even more about it as thought. This conceptually makes a lot of sense to me. Perhaps related to my day job where we look at machine learning and whether the models will understand language. I&#x27;ve been trying to simply describe why even though text-generation stuff is impressive I think it will be a long time before it can make senseibnle stories. A lack of concept seems the best explanation, especially because it doesn&#x27;t have that embodied experience.</p><p>The concept of creativity. Maybe actually start here, explaining the letter example (the four modes and also certainty waves) then talking about it in context of web design. I could also relate it to design systems.</p><p>I should keep this aroundand do it separately as a draft for later.</p></div></div></div><div style="text-indent:24px;padding:12px" class="jsx-3422114923">Generated<!-- --> on <!-- -->6/26/2019, 7:43:55 PM<!-- -->.</div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/2019-06-23-draft","query":{},"buildId":"YfMT7zmtDimbEXi0iiDRv","nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/posts/2019-06-23-draft" src="/_next/static/YfMT7zmtDimbEXi0iiDRv/pages/posts/2019-06-23-draft.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/YfMT7zmtDimbEXi0iiDRv/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-fdce77a122c11e06ae50.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.6429b73c2c169ed2ac6c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-9ebe6009cfc36b7e0de9.js" async=""></script></body></html>
