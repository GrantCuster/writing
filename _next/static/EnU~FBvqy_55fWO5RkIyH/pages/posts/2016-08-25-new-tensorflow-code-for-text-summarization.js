Interestingly, the models output abstractive - not extractive - summaries. Extractive summarization involves weighing words/sentences in a document according to some metric, and then selecting those words/sentences with high scores as proxies for the important content in a document. Abstractive summarization looks more like a human-written summary: inputting a document and outputting the points in one’s own words.
