Film-makers employ these patterns consciously. As film watchers, we may not think about scene types explicitly, but we do build up associations and expectations with different framing, movements, and styles. The side-by-side reinterpretations make this referential language more visible by showing us two examples at a time, helping us notice the similarity the machine has identified.

He has a model trained on specific types of art that interpret his webcam photos and generate new images: for example, a sheet becomes waves. Like in the trailer reinterpretations, what takes this beyond technical demo is how suggestive the association can be. The machine's ability to identify similarity between a sheet and a wave gives us an understanding that we can then apply outside of the context of the video. It’s a suggestive analogy that opens out so that the viewer can build upon it and make their own connections."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},LfFO:function(e,t,a){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/posts/2018-07-31-neural-reinterpretations-of-movie-trailers",function(){var e=a("5Cua");return{page:e.default||e}}])}},[["LfFO","5d41","9da1"]]]);
