These may be sounds in speech, music, urban or natural environments. Music is difficult because there is no universal model that could be reasonably applied to everything people label as music. Natural language is also fluid, but most of the time, models are constrained by the fact that people use natural language with the goal of conveying meaning unambiguously (literature, poetry, and humor aside).

At the time, the focus was on symbolic data, and researchers built expert systems using music theory concepts to analyze scores. In the early 2000s, the field shifted drastically in the wake of advances in speech processing. We threw aside symbolic information and rules based on music theory, and adopted a data-driven, statistical approach. That approach largely dominates to this day, with advances from feature learning and deep learning (both convolutional and recurrent nets) over the past few years. While deep nets excel at telling us what is in the data, however, we’re seeing limits where models overfit existing biases in our data sets. So, we’re trying to expand our approaches to embrace the possibility of multiple interpretations of the same information. There’s also a growing realization that data-driven techniques alone can only get us so far, that we’re shooting ourselves in the foot if we ignore the knowledge in music theory and theories of cognition. Some researchers, in turn, are trying to develop models with more emphasis on how we process information ourselves, how we interpret the structures that we understand as music.

There are only so many trained musicians motivated to listen to pieces of music and label structures, who can identify higher-order features like the intro, chorus, verse, verse with variations, and bridge that make up many pop songs. What counts as meaning and structure in music often extends along a relatively long time series. We do have some tricks we can use to gather more data useful for training. For example, with multi-track recordings, we can separate out melodic tracks before they’re mixed and then run pitch estimators on individual sources to characterize frequency values in a sequence. We’ve found the results have decent accuracy, and we can add a human in the loop to correct if needed.
