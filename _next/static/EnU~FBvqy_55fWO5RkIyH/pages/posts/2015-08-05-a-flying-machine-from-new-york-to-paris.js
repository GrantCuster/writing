He continues: “What limits the flight is the motor. No known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping, and you can’t be sure of finding the proper winds for soaring","…","But the history of civilization has usually shown that every new invention has brought in its train new needs it can satisfy, and so what the airship will eventually be used for is probably what we can least predict at the present.” "),Object(o.b)("p",null,"On July 2, 2015, our founder Hilary Mason boarded one of those airships (actually, if we follow Flyopia, ",Object(o.b)("a",{href:"http://flyopia.com/wilbur-wright-misquoted/"},"Wright was referring to a Zeppelin")," or a blimp rather than an airplane) in New York to deliver a talk on innovation and data science in Paris.
