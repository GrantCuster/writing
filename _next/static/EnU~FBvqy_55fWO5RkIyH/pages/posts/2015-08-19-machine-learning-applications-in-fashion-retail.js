Early research from a collaboration between ",Object(o.b)("a",{href:"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/zara?lang=en"},"Zara and MIT")," links product performance to the type of sizes available on the sales floor. When the standard sizes are missing (small, medium, or large) and only the endpoints of the size range are on display (extra-small or extra-large), the product will perform worse than a complete set of sizes and takes space from items more likely to sell. In their research, it was recommended for Zara to quickly replenish the standard sizes, remove the item from the floor entirely, or send it off to a store with a more complete set of sizes. That’s why smarter sensor inventory and smart mirrors in fitting rooms are even more important for moving excess inventory - what you see (on the floor) is not what you get.
