This is a very personal post and I'm a bit nervous I'm bending the talks I mention to fit the narrative I'm after. I think this post is a step towards me thinking about these issues more clearly, but just a first step. The last section on activism feels particulary sketchy.</Certainty>\n    <h2>{`Creativity and control`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There was a common structure to my favorite talks at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://eyeofestival.com/\"\n      }}>{`Eyeo`}</a>{`:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`A person develops an intense creative process to deal with feeling vulnerable. A place where they are in control.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`After some initial success, they realize the limitations of the space they've created.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`They find a way to incorporate the feelings they'd been avoiding their work, making themselves vulnerable and their art stronger. (This process is often messy and incomplete.)`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`This is my rough interpretation of the narrative of the talks I saw by `}<Person p={nicole} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{`, `}<Person p={nathan} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{`, `}<Person p={christina} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{`, and `}<Person p={paul} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{`. All of them reacted to personal challenges by turning to art or design, and then found they needed to confront those challenges within their work:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <Person p={nicole} mdxType=\"Person\" /> has started to share more of the process behind <Person p={nicole} v='their' mdxType=\"Person\" /> projects (including the poetry) in addition to the precision of the lasercut final artwork.\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <Person p={nathan} mdxType=\"Person\" /> is committed to moving out of <Person p={nathan} v='their' mdxType=\"Person\" /> comfort zone and interacting with people beyond <Person p={nathan} v='their' mdxType=\"Person\" /> writing and blog.\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <Person p={christina} mdxType=\"Person\" /> is incorporating more and more biographical elements into <Person p={christina} v='their' mdxType=\"Person\" /> videogame art worlds.\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <Person p={paul} mdxType=\"Person\" /> shifted his publishing and archiving practice to focus on radical queer art and culture as he became more comfortable with his own identity.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`It's personal`}</h2>\n    <p>{`These talks were important to me because I've been trying to figure out similar issues for myself. In design, I'm focused on creating minimal ordered systems. This desire for order carries over to how I organize my life: I wear the same outfit everyday, I eat a lot of the same meals. I know that these habits are a reaction to being uncomfortable with ambiguity, and retreating to spaces I can control.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Retreat or refuge`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Retreat is a negative interpretation of it, a more positive one would be that these spaces are a refuge, and that being able to visit them helps recover strength for dealing with the ambiguity in other parts of my life. I go back and forth on this. I think the ordered practices do help me recharge, but I worry they might lead to a desire to impose that order on all aspects of my life.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Ambiguity is other people`}</h2>\n    <p>{`And what exactly am I retreating or finding refuge from? Other people. I often don't know how other people are going to react and this stresses me out. On projects, I've dealt with this by doing more and more myself. Structuring them so I have less points of dependency on others. This is more comfortable but it's also limiting. I need to decide if I'm OK with that. Right now, I'm not sure.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Activism and organizing`}</h3>\n    <p>{`That question, of whether to retreat deeper into individual projects or make an effort to engage more with the outside world was put even more sharply by another group of talks, including `}<Person p={bufu} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{` and `}<Person p={sasha} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{`, focused on activisim and organizing. In organizing you're forced to deal with the messiness of others. The design challenge is how to act within that messiness. The aim is not to set up a perfect system but rather one that is robust and has mechanisms for self-correction.`}</p>\n    <p>{`That feels like very important and worthwile work to me. It's not the first time in my life I've wondered whether the truly responsible thing for me to do would be to get involved in community and political organizing. It's worth noting how privilege plays out here as well. As `}<Person p={sasha} mdxType=\"Person\" />{`'s section on going through a TSA scanner as a nonbinary, transgender, femme presenting person demonstrated, the way the world is set-up right now makes it impossible for people of marginalized identities to just go about their work. As a straight, cis, white man, those systems mostly will allow me to just make generative graph layouts all day. The question is whether my conscience will.`}</p>\n    <p><p><Person p={paul} mdxType=\"Person\" />{`'s talk was a really moving examination of these issues for me. As `}<Person p={paul} v=\"they\" mdxType=\"Person\" />{` reconciled with `}<Person p={paul} v=\"their\" mdxType=\"Person\" />{` queer identity, `}<Person p={paul} v='they' mdxType=\"Person\" />{` started to bring it more into `}<Person p={paul} v='their' mdxType=\"Person\" />{` work. He shifted `}<Person p={paul} v='their' mdxType=\"Person\" />{`  archiving and publishing focus from  experimental internet work to experimental queer work, and structured his teaching to try and disrupt current systems. `}<Person p={paul} v='their' cap mdxType=\"Person\" />{` talk raised the question of how to reconcile a love for experimental design with living in a world where other issues seem much more urgent. It felt like a very personal account of `}<Person p={paul} v='them' mdxType=\"Person\" />{` working out an answer to that question for `}<Person p={paul} v=\"themself\" mdxType=\"Person\" />{`.`}</p></p>\n    <p>{`Haunting all of this was `}<Person p={jenny} v='full' link mdxType=\"Person\" />{`'s book `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`How to Do Nothing`}</em>{`. I finished the book just before the conference. There was so much in it that I should do a separate post. The thing that pleasantly surprised me was how much of it was focused on the connections between a creative practice and activism, and how it looked at balancing the two. I was particularly interested in the section on Thomas Merton, and how temporary withdrawal (or withdrawal in certain aspects) can fuel engagement. I think this is the most positive and convincing version of the creative practice as refuge idea: you can experiment with different modes of living within your scoped creative experiments, and then that energy back into your engagement with the world. I still have a lot to figure out in terms of what that balance could look like for myself, but I'm glad to be thinking and writing about it again.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n  "],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAHA;AACA;AAIA;AACA;AACA;AAFA;AAIA;AACA;AAGA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAEA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
