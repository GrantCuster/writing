The thing that pleasantly surprised me was how much of it was focused on the connections between a creative practice and activism, and how it looked at balancing the two. I was particularly interested in the section on Thomas Merton, and how temporary withdrawal (or withdrawal in certain aspects) can fuel engagement. I think this is the most positive and convincing version of the creative practice as refuge idea: you can experiment with different modes of living within your scoped creative experiments, and then that energy back into your engagement with the world. I still have a lot to figure out in terms of what that balance could look like for myself, but I'm glad to be thinking about it again."));
