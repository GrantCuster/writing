Transfer learning assumes that neural net architectures generalize to similar problems (for example, features like corners and lines show up in many different images); neural architecture search assumes that each dataset needs a unique and specialized architecture. In transfer learning, you start with a trained model with an existing architecture and further tune the weights with your data; neural architecture search requires training multiple new architectures along with new weights.
